I love music so much from my childhood. I still remember that the weekend means all the Sundays in my family was fixed 
as a music day. All through the day, the slow music was running in the centre of the house and every family member was
doing their work. It was my dad who inspires all family members to listen music. It helps us in keeping our mind strong 
and busy. Music is like a meditation and benefits a lot to us if we listen music on daily basis. Some students are habitual to 
listen music during their study time, without music they cannot read.

Music is like yoga, it makes us happy and helps in keeping hormonal balance in the body, relief our body and mind and 
thus keeps us physically and mentally healthy. It prevents us from being obese and overweight as well as other mental 
problems. I Love music so much and listen every morning.
