A journey by train is among the most enjoyable journeys. I travel long distance quite often and have travelled via buses, trains as well as aeroplanes.
While each of these journeys has its set of benefits, I personally love train journeys.
A journey by train is the best if you have enough time and have to travel long distance. 
This is the only means of transport that allows you to sleep comfortably during the journey. 
I prefer travelling at night. I can comfortably sleep in the train during my journey and wake up fresh and head to work during my official trips. 
One of my most memorable journeys by train was when I travelled from Delhi to Lucknow last year. I went to visit my relatives in Lucknow. 
During this train journey, I met a group of college students. The group was lively, cheerful and extremely friendly.
As I was sitting right besides them, they offered me some snacks and cold drink. They soon began conversing with me.
 They narrated some of their experiences and I shared mine. I also gave them career advice. 
The six hours journey passed very swiftly and we reached Lucknow. As we parted, we exchanged our phone numbers and promised to keep in touch.
